        <div class="plo">PLO4 - Utilize instructional strategies and communication in both formal and informal interactions to increase information competence.</div>
        <p>My classes and experiences at UNCG did not focus on library instruction, but there is a certain level of instruction and education that all librarians must be familiar with, and I certainly had plenty of opportunities to develop skills in the dimensions of PLO 4.</p>

          <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1q9zzAIm9HP14bHCQQgJ8zLZKCVvwF2YkpNl-Q3BCcmE/present" target="_blank" style="width:200px;"><strong>Xwi7xwa Library</strong></br>Slideshow</a>
        </div>
        <p>One fascinating of instructional philosophy that I experienced in LIS 640 - Information Organization was related to the cataloging practices of the Xwi7xwa Library. This is an academic branch library that is embedded in a department of education, but also uses a customized indigenous knowledge management system. Given that the majority of their users are aspiring primary school teachers, they have a significant amount of literature aimed at children and young adults. Unfortunately, because of how Alaska Natives, First Nations, and Native Americans have been depicted over the years in this literature, the Xwi7xwa Library maintains a separate section of their catalog for works that “require careful interpretation”. To me this represents a powerful example of how cataloging and metadata can themselves be instructional and shape the way patrons seek and find information. I consider this an important component of dimension 4.1, Identify Instructional Needs. Even when a librarian is not performing direct instruction, there are still ways that they can meet the instructional needs of their patrons.</p>

        </div>
        <p>A major component of LIS 618 - Materials for Adolescents was a video booktalk, designed to present several books that we read over the course of the class on a common theme. This was a completely new experience for me, and I was introduced to several related dimensions of this PLO in assembling this project. For dimension 4.2, Design Instruction, I was forced to consider the informational needs and goals of a patron population I had never directly worked with - adolescents. I had to consider my approach from their perspective and meet them on their level. For dimension 4.3, Deliver Instruction, the process of scripting and recording the video talk was a very challenging balance. I wanted the talk to be casual and approachable, while still being informational and insightful. It took several takes and some adjustments to my tone of voice and language to strike the right balance. That of course leads directly into dimension 4.4, Assessment of Instruction. Being critical of my own performance and content was essential in creating a product that met the needs of the hypothetical teens I was attempting to reach.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Dimension 4.5, Support Patron Learning through Effective Instructional Communication includes in its description the importance of creating informal learning during patron interactions. One example of that concept that I experienced in my LIS program is an assignment to create a LibGuide for Evidence-Based Nursing. Creating a LibGuide (or other online guide) is a great example of going beyond patrons’ basic needs. A catalog search will find the type of information the patron is looking for, but by curating the best resources of a variety of types the librarian is creating the kind of specialized instructional material that is not available anywhere else.</p>
