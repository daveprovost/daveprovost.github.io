        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Originally designed for the sharing of photos, Instagram has expanded its scope by allowing video and livestreams, but the biggest development for this network was its acquisition by Facebook, partly as a way to prevent the nascent network from becoming a true rival.</p>
        <h2>Strengths & Weaknesses</h2>
        <p>The iconic square-cropped photo is instantly recognizable as “Instagram” and the visual focus of the network helps it feel approachable and gives it an appealing visual experience. The mobile-focused experience can be challenging for folks that would prefer to use a computer, and there is less opportunity for building a true community, given the way comments are much more of an afterthought than on some other platforms. </p>
        <h2>Recommendations</h2>
        <p>Instagram is a great tool for broadcasting information and making sure that your library remains “top-of-mind” for your patrons who are members of this platform. A scheduling tool like Hootsuite or similar can be useful to ensure your posts are coming at a regular clip, especially since back-and-forth interaction is less important on this platform.</p>
        <h2>What can we learn?</h2>
        <p>The importance of a well-crafted visual is immediately apparent on Instagram, but attractive graphic design and eye-catching photography are helpful for building a vibrant and welcoming virtual community.</p>
