        <div class="plo">PLO5 - Advocate for public policies, laws, organizations, and resources that promote a just information society.</div>
        <p>	It’s become increasingly clear that the idea of libraries as neutral, non-political entities is unjust and oppressive. I’ve been encouraged to see that many of my classes here at UNCG have embraced the idea that libraries can be a powerful engine for social justice.</p>
        <div class="artifact">
          <a href="reaction.pdf" target="_blank" style="width:200px;"><strong>Reaction Paper</strong></br>Document</a>
        </div>
        <p>	Dimension 5.1, Information Policy, directs us to “assess the potential impacts of policy and laws on the ability of libraries … to fulfill their missions”. One of the first assignments I had in library school was a reaction paper to the ALA’s Libraries’ Bill of Rights, specifically Article VI, which is about making meeting rooms available to all on an “equitable basis”. I took a stance that I think is becoming more popular among librarians, which is that we have to find a way to prevent hate groups and extremists from making our libraries a less welcoming and inclusive space, merely by showing up and intimidating staff and patrons.</p>
        <div class="artifact">
          <a href="trends.html" target="_blank" style="width:200px;"><strong>Virtual Communities</strong></br>Webpage</a>
        </div>
        <p>	The culmination of my LIS 674 - Issues in Virtual Communities seminar was an in depth analysis of trends in virtual communities and how those trends influence libraries, and maybe how libraries can influence them. This was right in line with dimension 5.2, Current Trends. In addition to evaluating several existing social media platforms, I came to the conclusion that public libraries should be exploring the possibility of creating their own virtual spaces and communities. Libraries are uniquely positioned as a place where people from all facets of society can come together for an increasing range of resources and activities, and there is no reason why we should not expand that sense of community to the virtual world.</p>
        <p>In 2020, there was a major battle in Congress over funding for the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) and the Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA). When I got an email from one of my professors (Dr. Anthony Chow) asking for volunteers to go to Washington DC to meet with Senators and Representatives to explain how important funding for libraries was, even in the midst of a raging pandemic. It was inspirational to see faculty and students working together to advocate for libraries, and I volunteered to be a part of the delegation. Dimensions 5.3 and 5.4 discuss the importance of advocacy within and without the professional, and I felt like this was a great opportunity to contribute. Though I wasn’t chosen to attend, I still used that sense of inspiration and collegiality to call my Members of Congress and express the importance of funding for libraries and other information organizations. I hope to bring this sense of community activism and professional advocacy into my career (and personal life) going forward.</p>
        <div class="artifact">
          <a href="urvmpl.pdf" target="_blank" style="width:200px;"><strong>Personal Librarian Project</strong></br>Proposal</a>
        </div>
        <p>	In my professional life as a veterinary medical librarian, I feel that I have a huge responsibility to advocate for and support my patrons that are members of minority groups that are underrepresented in veterinary medicine (URVM). This is exactly what I feel dimension 5.5 is asking of us. The pilot project that I developed in LIS 662 Information Services for Diverse Client Groups is, I think, an excellent example of how to support historically marginalized groups and could potentially contribute to larger numbers of URVM students at my university. The concept built on a number of existing programs at the institution where I work that assign a “personal librarian” to every individual in certain categories that might struggle with connecting with the library. Currently personal librarians are assigned to transfer students and residents and interns in the College of Veterinary Medicine. This project, which makes personal librarians available to URVM students, would be a way to provide individualized support and build a connection that might otherwise not happen.</p>
