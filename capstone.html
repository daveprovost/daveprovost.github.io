        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
          <p>The User Experience team at the NC State University Libraries has conducted many surveys and studies of library users at the University. One type of study that can provide a unique perspective is a longer-term diary study. This type of study is challenging for the department to carry out, as it is time-consuming to ensure that participants are following up with their responses and to sift through the large amount of data collected. The User Experience team developed a proposal to have a Libraries Fellow develop and conduct a diary study, but the Fellow selected ended up not coming to NC State. This Capstone Work Experience is designed to develop and carry out a diary study in conjunction with the User Experience Team, the User Research Group, and other Libraries departments.</p>
        <h2>Steps Taken</h2>
          <p>As a member of the Libraries User Research Group, I am already familiar with the members of the User Experience team and their approach to user research and studies. As part of my job in the Veterinary Medicine Library, we have often considered our own user research projects, but have not had the expertise and experience to carry one out. This work experience will allow me to combine my classroom learning at UNC Greensboro with real-world experience to benefit both the Libraries and my own professional development.</p>
          <p>The NC State University Libraries User Experience team is made up of 5 full-time staff members and has carried out dozens if not hundreds of surveys, interviews and other user research projects for the Libraries. The User Experience Department helps users navigate and understand the Libraries by identifying and acting on opportunities for user-centered design across the institution. The team develops and maintains the Libraries' web presence and physical signage. The department learns from the techniques and insights of the broader realm of UX, and actively contributes to the field of library user experience.</p>
        <h2>Evaluation</h2>
          <p>While the ultimate purpose of this user research study is to answer questions to help the Libraries improve the experience of using the library, my personal goal with this Capstone is to gain experience in identifying useful questions to ask and developing a survey instrument to answer those questions. The data generated in this study may not be fully assessed and integrated in the Libraries' planning process for some time, but developing a successful survey will enable me to align all of the information I have learned at UNC Greensboro with real-world experience that I can put into practice in my own workplace going forward.</p>
